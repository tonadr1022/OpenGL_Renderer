# OpenGL Renderer

This is a basic 3D renderer written in C++ and OpenGL. Its main purpose has been for me to learn more rendering
techniques while abstracting them into
an API that allows for scene creation without making OpenGL calls. Along the way, it has improved my C++ skills,
although I'm learning that C++ (and graphics programming for that matter) is really a lifelong journey.

## Building

On MacOS and Linux:

```shell
sh build_run_debug.sh
# or 
sh build_run_release.sh
```

On Windows (Using Visual Studio 2022 as CMake generator):

```
win_build_run_debug.bat
or
win_build_run_release.bat
```

Or Open the project in an IDE and build from there if these scripts don't work (Still learning CMake)

## Features

- 3D model loading
- Orbit/FPS cameras
- Skybox
- Blinn-Phong lighting: Ambient, Diffuse, Specular, Emission maps
- MSAA
- Stencil Outlining (eventually object selection)
- Dockable ImGui interface
- Screenshots

### MSAA

## TODO (soon to far)

- Framebuffer stack for multiple post-processing effects
- Uniform buffer objects (uniforms across shaders)
- GPU instancing
- PBR
- Commit to actually learning CMake and cross-platform compatibility (Ugh)
- Rewrite in OpenGL 4.6 with data oriented approach (batched rendering, direct state access)
- Learn Vulkan
